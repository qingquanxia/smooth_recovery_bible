<p id="FSa26-3" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:3</a></b>And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite the desert, by the road.

And Abishai said, I will go down with you.</p>
<p id="FSa26-7" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:7</a></b>So David and Abishai went to the people by night; and there lay Saul, sleeping within the entrenchment, and his spear was stuck in the ground by his head.

<p id="FSa26-8" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:8</a></b>And Abishai said to David, God has delivered your enemy into your hand today.

<p id="FSa26-14" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:14</a></b>And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Will you not answer, Abner? And Abner answered and said, Who are you that calls out to the king?</p>
<p id="FSa26-15" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:15</a></b>And David said to Abner, Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel?

<p id="FSa26-17" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:17</a></b>And Saul recognized David&rsquo;s voice; and he said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</p>

<p id="FSa26-19" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:19</a></b>Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is Jehovah who has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it is the sons of men, let them be cursed before Jehovah; for they have driven me out today, so that I cannot share in Jehovah&rsquo;s inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.</p>
<p id="FSa26-20" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:20</a></b>Now therefore do not let my blood fall to the ground apart from the presence of Jehovah; for the king of Israel has come forth to seek a single flea, as one might hunt a partridge in the mountains.</p>
<p id="FSa26-21" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:21</a></b>And Saul said, I have sinned.

<p id="FSa26-25" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 26</a><a href="09_1Samuel_26.htm#FSa26">:25</a></b>And Saul said to David, Blessed are you, my son David. You shall most certainly both do and prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</p>
