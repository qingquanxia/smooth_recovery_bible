<p id="Act5-2" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:2</a></b>and put aside for himself some of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it. And he brought some part <i>of it</i> and laid <i>it</i> at the feet of the apostles.</p>
<p id="Act5-3" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:3</a></b>But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to deceive the Holy Spirit and to put aside for yourself some of the proceeds of the land?</p>
<p id="Act5-4" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:4</a></b>While it remained, was it not your own? And when it was sold, was it not under your authority?

<p id="Act5-9" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:9</a></b>And Peter <i>said</i> to her, Why <i>is it</i> that it was agreed between you <i>two</i> to test the Spirit of the Lord?

<p id="Act5-15" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:15</a></b>so that they even carried the sick out into the streets and placed <i>them</i> on cots and mats, in order that when Peter came, at least his shadow might overshadow some of them.</p>
<p id="Act5-16" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:16</a></b>And the multitude from the cities surrounding Jerusalem also came together, carrying the sick and those troubled by unclean spirits, for such ones were all being healed.</p>

<p id="Act5-26" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:26</a></b>Then the captain with the officers went away and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they would be stoned.</p>
<p id="Act5-27" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:27</a></b>And having brought them, they stood <i>them</i> in the Sanhedrin. And the high priest questioned them,</p>

<p id="Act5-34" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:34</a></b>But a certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrin named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law honored by all the people, stood up and commanded that they put the men outside for a little while.</p>
<p id="Act5-35" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:35</a></b>And he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves with regard to these men, in what you are about to do.</p>
<p id="Act5-36" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:36</a></b>For before these days Theudas rose up, saying that he was somebody, with whom a number of men, about four hundred, took sides.

<p id="Act5-37" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:37</a></b>After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away <i>a group of</i> people after him. And that man perished, and all who were persuaded by him were scattered.</p>
<p id="Act5-38" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:38</a></b>And now I say to you, withdraw from these men and leave them alone; for should this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown;</p>
<p id="Act5-39" class="verse"><b><a href="44_Acts_1.htm">Ac 5</a><a href="44_Acts_5.htm#Act5">:39</a></b>but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest you be found to be even fighters against God.</p>
