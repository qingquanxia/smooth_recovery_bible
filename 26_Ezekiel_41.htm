<p id="Eze41-3" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:3</a></b>Then He went into the inner <i>temple</i> and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width <i>on either side of</i> the entrance, seven cubits.</p>
<p id="Eze41-4" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:4</a></b>And He measured the length <i>of the inner temple,</i> twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the <i>outer</i> temple; and He said to me, This is the Holy of Holies.</p>

<p id="Eze41-7" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:7</a></b>And the side chambers that went around <i>the house</i> became wider as they went up by stories. Because the surrounding of the house increased upward around the house, therefore the house had width upward; and so one went up <i>from</i> the lowest <i>story</i> to the highest through the middle <i>story.</i></p>

And the <i>outer</i> temple, the inner <i>temple,</i> the porches of the court,</p>
<p id="Eze41-16" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:16</a></b>the thresholds, the latticed windows, and the galleries of the surrounding <i>side chambers</i> with their three stories, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, even <i>from</i> the ground to the windows (now the windows were latticed),</p>
<p id="Eze41-17" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:17</a></b>to the top of the entrance, both in the inner house and outside. And on all the walls all around inside and outside, by measurement,</p>

<p id="Eze41-19" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:19</a></b>So there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other side. So it was carved in and around the whole house.</p>
<p id="Eze41-20" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:20</a></b>From the ground to the top of the entrance cherubim and palm trees were carved, even <i>on</i> the wall of the temple.</p>
<p id="Eze41-21" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:21</a></b>The temple doorposts were squared. And <i>at</i> the front of the sanctuary was something in appearance like the appearance of</p>
<p id="Eze41-22" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:22</a></b>a wooden altar, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, its length, and its walls were <i>made of</i> wood.

<p id="Eze41-23" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:23</a></b>Now the temple and the sanctuary had double doors.</p>

<p id="Eze41-25" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:25</a></b>And carved on these, on the doors of the temple, were cherubim and palm trees, just like those carved on the walls. And there was a threshold of wood upon the front of the porch outside.</p>
<p id="Eze41-26" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 41</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_41.htm#Eze41">:26</a></b>And there were latticed windows and palm trees on either side, on the sides of the porch, the side chambers of the house, and the thresholds.</p>
