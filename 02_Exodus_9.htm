<p id="Exo9-3" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:3</a></b>then the hand of Jehovah is going to be on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very severe pestilence.</p>
<p id="Exo9-4" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:4</a></b>And Jehovah will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing will die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.</p>

<p id="Exo9-15" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:15</a></b>For if by now I had stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, you would have been cut off from the earth.</p>

<p id="Exo9-27" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:27</a></b>And Pharaoh sent <i>a messenger</i> and called for Moses and Aaron; and he said to them, I have sinned this time; Jehovah is the righteous One, and I and my people are in the wrong.</p>
<p id="Exo9-28" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:28</a></b>Entreat Jehovah, for there has been enough of God&rsquo;s thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.</p>
<p id="Exo9-29" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:29</a></b>And Moses said to him, As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Jehovah: The thunder will cease, and there will not be any more hail, that you may know that the earth is Jehovah&rsquo;s.</p>
<p id="Exo9-30" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:30</a></b>But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="Exo9-31" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:31</a></b>(Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bud.</p>
<p id="Exo9-32" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:32</a></b>But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they had not come up.)</p>

<p id="Exo9-34" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:34</a></b>But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</p>
<p id="Exo9-35" class="verse"><b><a href="02_Exodus_1.htm">Ex 9</a><a href="02_Exodus_9.htm#Exo9">:35</a></b>So Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, just as Jehovah had spoken through Moses.</p>
