<p id="Heb8-1" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:1</a></b>Now in the things which are being said the chief point <i>is this:</i> We have such a High Priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</p>
<p id="Heb8-2" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:2</a></b>a Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</p>
<p id="Heb8-3" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:3</a></b>For every high priest is established for the offering of both gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary that this One also have something which He may offer.</p>
<p id="Heb8-4" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:4</a></b>Now then if He were on earth, He would not be a Priest at all, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,</p>
<p id="Heb8-5" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:5</a></b>who serve the example and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to complete the tabernacle; for, &ldquo;See,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="Heb8-6" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:6</a></b>But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.</p>
<p id="Heb8-7" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:7</a></b>For if that first <i>covenant</i> had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.</p>
<p id="Heb8-8" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:8</a></b>For finding fault with them He says, &ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah,</p>
<p id="Heb8-9" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:9</a></b>not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.</p>
<p id="Heb8-10" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:10</a></b>For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.</p>
<p id="Heb8-11" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:11</a></b>And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.</p>
<p id="Heb8-12" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:12</a></b>For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="Heb8-13" class="verse"><b><a href="58_Hebrews_1.htm">He 8</a><a href="58_Hebrews_8.htm#Heb8">:13</a></b>In saying, A new <i>covenant,</i> He has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing.</p>
