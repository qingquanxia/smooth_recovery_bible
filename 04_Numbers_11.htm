<p id="Num11-20" class="verse"><b><a href="04_Numbers_1.htm">Nm 11</a><a href="04_Numbers_11.htm#Num11">:20</a></b>but a whole month, until it comes out from your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected Jehovah who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, Why did we ever come out of Egypt?</p>
<p id="Num11-21" class="verse"><b><a href="04_Numbers_1.htm">Nm 11</a><a href="04_Numbers_11.htm#Num11">:21</a></b>But Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand on foot; and You have said, I will give them meat so that they may eat a whole month.</p>

<p id="Num11-31" class="verse"><b><a href="04_Numbers_1.htm">Nm 11</a><a href="04_Numbers_11.htm#Num11">:31</a></b>And a wind went forth from Jehovah and brought quails from the sea and let <i>them</i> fall beside the camp, about a day&rsquo;s journey on this side and a day&rsquo;s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.</p>
