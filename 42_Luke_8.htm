<p id="Luk8-4" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:4</a></b>And while a great crowd was coming together and those from city to city were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable:</p>
<p id="Luk8-5" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:5</a></b>The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some <i>seed</i> fell beside the way, and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of heaven devoured it.</p>
<p id="Luk8-6" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:6</a></b>And other <i>seed</i> fell on the rock, and as it grew, it withered because it had no moisture.</p>
<p id="Luk8-7" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:7</a></b>And other <i>seed</i> fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns grew with <i>it</i> and choked it off.</p>

<p id="Luk8-10" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:10</a></b>And He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest <i>they are</i> in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</p>
<p id="Luk8-11" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:11</a></b>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p>
<p id="Luk8-12" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:12</a></b>And those beside the way are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they would not believe and be saved.</p>
<p id="Luk8-13" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:13</a></b>And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; yet these have no root, who believe <i>only</i> for a while, and in time of trial they draw back.</p>
<p id="Luk8-14" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:14</a></b>And that which fell into the thorns, these are those who heard and, going away, are utterly choked by anxieties and riches and pleasures of this life, and do not bring <i>any fruit</i> to maturity.</p>
<p id="Luk8-15" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:15</a></b>But that which is in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart hear the word and hold <i>it</i> fast and bear fruit with endurance.</p>
<p id="Luk8-16" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:16</a></b>Now no one who has lit a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts <i>it</i> underneath a bed, but he puts <i>it</i> on a lampstand in order that those who come in may see the light.</p>
<p id="Luk8-17" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:17</a></b>For nothing is hidden which shall not become manifest, nor concealed which shall not by all means be made known and come into the open.</p>
<p id="Luk8-18" class="verse"><b><a href="42_Luke_1.htm">Lk 8</a><a href="42_Luke_8.htm#Luk8">:18</a></b>Take heed therefore how you hear, for whoever has, it shall be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.</p>
