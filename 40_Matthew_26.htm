<p id="Mat26-2" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:2</a></b>you know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man is being delivered up to be crucified.</p>
<p id="Mat26-3" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:3</a></b>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>
<p id="Mat26-4" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:4</a></b>and they took counsel together to seize Jesus by craftiness and kill <i>Him.</i></p>
<p id="Mat26-5" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:5</a></b>But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p>
<p id="Mat26-6" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:6</a></b>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>

<p id="Mat26-8" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:8</a></b>But when the disciples saw <i>it,</i> they were indignant, saying, Why this waste?</p>
<p id="Mat26-9" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:9</a></b>For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor.</p>
<p id="Mat26-10" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:10</a></b>But Jesus, knowing <i>it,</i> said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a noble deed to Me.</p>

<p id="Mat26-15" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:15</a></b>and said, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they weighed out to him thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p id="Mat26-16" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:16</a></b>And from then on he sought opportunity to deliver Him up.</p>
<p id="Mat26-17" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:17</a></b>Now on the first day of the <i>Feast</i><i> of</i> Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the passover?</p>
<p id="Mat26-18" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:18</a></b>And He said, Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near. I am keeping the passover at your <i>house</i> with My disciples.</p>
<p id="Mat26-19" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:19</a></b>And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the passover.</p>
<p id="Mat26-20" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:20</a></b>And when evening fell, He reclined <i>at table</i> with the twelve.</p>

<p id="Mat26-22" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:22</a></b>And being greatly grieved, each one of them began to say to Him, I am not <i>the one,</i> am I, Lord?</p>
<p id="Mat26-23" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:23</a></b>And He answered and said, The one who dips his hand with Me in the dish, this one will betray Me.</p>
<p id="Mat26-24" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:24</a></b>The Son of Man is going away, even as it is written concerning Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.</p>
<p id="Mat26-25" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:25</a></b>And Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, I am not <i>the one,</i> am I, Rabbi? He said to him, You have said <i>it</i> yourself.</p>
<p id="Mat26-26" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:26</a></b>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed <i>it,</i> and He broke <i>it</i> and gave <i>it</i> to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.</p>
<p id="Mat26-27" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:27</a></b>And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, Drink of it, all <i>of you,</i></p>
<p id="Mat26-28" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:28</a></b>for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.</p>

<p id="Mat26-30" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:30</a></b>And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p id="Mat26-31" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:31</a></b>Then Jesus said to them, You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, &ldquo;I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="Mat26-32" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:32</a></b>But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>

<p id="Mat26-34" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:34</a></b>Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that in this night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.</p>
<p id="Mat26-35" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:35</a></b>Peter said to Him, Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You. And all the disciples said likewise.</p>
<p id="Mat26-36" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 26</a><a href="40_Matthew_26.htm#Mat26">:36</a></b>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and He said to the disciples, Sit here while I go over there and pray.</p>
