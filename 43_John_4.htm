<p id="Joh4-2" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:2</a></b>(although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but <i>rather</i> His disciples),</p>
<p id="Joh4-3" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:3</a></b>He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.</p>

<p id="Joh4-5" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:5</a></b>So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;</p>
<p id="Joh4-6" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:6</a></b>and Jacob&rsquo;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the well; it was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p id="Joh4-7" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:7</a></b>There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me <i>something</i> to drink.</p>

<p id="Joh4-13" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:13</a></b>Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again,</p>
<p id="Joh4-14" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:14</a></b>but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.</p>
<p id="Joh4-15" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:15</a></b>The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw.</p>

<p id="Joh4-18" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:18</a></b>for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.</p>

<p id="Joh4-20" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:20</a></b>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where <i>men</i> must worship.</p>
<p id="Joh4-21" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:21</a></b>Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</p>
<p id="Joh4-22" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:22</a></b>You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is of the Jews.</p>
<p id="Joh4-23" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:23</a></b>But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him.</p>
<p id="Joh4-24" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:24</a></b>God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.</p>
<p id="Joh4-25" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:25</a></b>The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when He comes, He will declare all things to us.</p>
<p id="Joh4-26" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:26</a></b>Jesus said to her, I, who speak to you, am <i>He.</i></p>
<p id="Joh4-27" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:27</a></b>And at this <i>point</i> His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are You seeking? or, Why are You speaking with her?</p>
<p id="Joh4-28" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:28</a></b>Then the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city, and said to the people,</p>
<p id="Joh4-29" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:29</a></b>Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?</p>
<p id="Joh4-30" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:30</a></b>They went out of the city and came to Him.</p>
<p id="Joh4-31" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:31</a></b>In the meantime, the disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</p>
<p id="Joh4-32" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:32</a></b>But He said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about.</p>

<p id="Joh4-34" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:34</a></b>Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.</p>
<p id="Joh4-35" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:35</a></b>Do you not say that there are yet four months and then the harvest comes? Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest.</p>

<p id="Joh4-37" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:37</a></b>For in this the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.</p>

<p id="Joh4-39" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:39</a></b>And many of the Samaritans from that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all that I have done.</p>

<p id="Joh4-44" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:44</a></b>for Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</p>
<p id="Joh4-45" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:45</a></b>Then when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that He did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.</p>
<p id="Joh4-46" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:46</a></b>He then came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick in Capernaum.</p>
<p id="Joh4-47" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:47</a></b>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and asked <i>Him</i> to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</p>
<p id="Joh4-48" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 4</a><a href="43_John_4.htm#Joh4">:48</a></b>Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.</p>
