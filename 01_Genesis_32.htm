<p id="Gen32-18" class="verse"><b><a href="01_Genesis_1.htm">Gn 32</a><a href="01_Genesis_32.htm#Gen32">:18</a></b>Then you will say, Your servant Jacob&rsquo;s; it is a present sent to my lord Esau; and now he also is behind us.</p>
<p id="Gen32-19" class="verse"><b><a href="01_Genesis_1.htm">Gn 32</a><a href="01_Genesis_32.htm#Gen32">:19</a></b>And he commanded also the second and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, In this way you shall speak to Esau when you find him,</p>
<p id="Gen32-20" class="verse"><b><a href="01_Genesis_1.htm">Gn 32</a><a href="01_Genesis_32.htm#Gen32">:20</a></b>and you shall also say, Your servant Jacob is right behind us.
