<p id="Jos10-2" class="verse"><b><a href="06_Joshua_1.htm">Js 10</a><a href="06_Joshua_10.htm#Jos10">:2</a></b>they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai and all its men were mighty men.</p>
<p id="Jos10-3" class="verse"><b><a href="06_Joshua_1.htm">Js 10</a><a href="06_Joshua_10.htm#Jos10">:3</a></b>So Adoni-zedek the king of Jerusalem sent <i>word</i> to Hoham the king of Hebron and Piram the king of Jarmuth and Japhia the king of Lachish and Debir the king of Eglon, saying,</p>
