<p id="FSa2-29" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 2</a><a href="09_1Samuel_2.htm#FSa2">:29</a></b>Why then do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering, which I have commanded in <i>My</i> habitation, and honor your sons more than Me by making yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?</p>
<p id="FSa2-30" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 2</a><a href="09_1Samuel_2.htm#FSa2">:30</a></b>Therefore Jehovah the God of Israel declares, I surely said that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever; but now Jehovah declares, Far be it from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who spurn Me will be lightly esteemed.</p>
