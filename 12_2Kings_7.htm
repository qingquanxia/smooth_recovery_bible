<p id="SKi7-1" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:1</a></b>And Elisha said, Hear the word of Jehovah: Thus says Jehovah, At about this time tomorrow a seah of fine flour <i>will be sold</i> for a shekel and two seahs of barley <i>will be sold</i> for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.</p>
<p id="SKi7-2" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:2</a></b>Then the captain on whose arm the king leaned answered the man of God and said, Even if Jehovah made windows in heaven, could this thing happen? And he said, Your eyes shall indeed see <i>it,</i> but you shall not eat from it.</p>
<p id="SKi7-3" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:3</a></b>Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. And they said to one another, Why are we sitting here until we die?</p>
<p id="SKi7-4" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:4</a></b>If we say, Let us enter the city, the famine is in the city and we will die there; but if we sit here, we will also die. Now therefore let us go and desert to the camp of the Syrians. If they keep us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will die.</p>
<p id="SKi7-5" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:5</a></b>So they rose up in the twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. And when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, there was not a man there.</p>
<p id="SKi7-6" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:6</a></b>Now the Lord had made the camp of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots <i>and</i> the sound of horses, the sound of a great army; and each man said to his brother, Now the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come against us.</p>
<p id="SKi7-7" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:7</a></b>And they rose up and fled in the twilight, and they abandoned their tents and their horses and their donkeys, <i>indeed</i> the <i>whole</i> camp just as it was, and fled for their lives.</p>
<p id="SKi7-8" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:8</a></b>So when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they entered one tent and began to eat and drink. And they took silver and gold and clothing from there, and went and hid <i>them.</i> And they went back and entered another tent and took <i>things</i> from there and went and hid <i>them.</i></p>
<p id="SKi7-9" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:9</a></b>Then they said to one another, We are not doing right. This day is a day of good tidings, and we remain silent. If we delay until the morning&rsquo;s light, <i>our</i> iniquity will find us out. Now therefore, come and let us go and tell the king&rsquo;s household.</p>
<p id="SKi7-10" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:10</a></b>So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city and told them saying, We went to the camp of the Syrians, and there was not a man there nor even the sound of a man; but the horses were tied, and the donkeys were tied, and the tents were <i>left</i> as they were.</p>
<p id="SKi7-11" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:11</a></b>And the gatekeepers proclaimed <i>it</i> and told the king&rsquo;s household within.</p>
<p id="SKi7-12" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:12</a></b>And the king rose up in the night and said to his servants, I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us: They know that we are hungry; and they have gone out from the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out from the city, we will take them alive; and into the city we will go.</p>
<p id="SKi7-13" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:13</a></b>And one of his servants answered and said, Let <i>some men</i> take five of the remaining horses that are left in the city&nbsp;&mdash; they are like all the multitude of Israel which remain in the city; they are like all the multitude of Israel which have perished&nbsp;&mdash; and let us send <i>them</i> and see.</p>
<p id="SKi7-14" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:14</a></b>So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent <i>them</i> after the army of Syria, saying, Go and see.</p>
<p id="SKi7-15" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:15</a></b>And when they went after them toward the Jordan, all the way was full of garments and equipment that the Syrians had thrown off in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.</p>
<p id="SKi7-16" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:16</a></b>And the people went forth and plundered the camp of the Syrians. And a seah of fine flour was <i>sold</i> for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="SKi7-17" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:17</a></b>Now the king had appointed the captain on whose arm he leaned to have charge of the gate; and the people trampled him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king had come down to him.</p>
<p id="SKi7-18" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:18</a></b>So just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two seahs of barley will be <i>sold</i> for a shekel and a seah of fine flour will be <i>sold</i> for a shekel at about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria;</p>
<p id="SKi7-19" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:19</a></b>and the captain had answered the man of God and said, Even if Jehovah made windows in heaven, could this thing happen? and <i>the man of God</i> had said, Your eyes shall indeed see <i>it,</i> but you shall not eat from it;</p>
<p id="SKi7-20" class="verse"><b><a href="12_2Kings_1.htm">2K 7</a><a href="12_2Kings_7.htm#SKi7">:20</a></b>so it happened to him; for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.</p>
