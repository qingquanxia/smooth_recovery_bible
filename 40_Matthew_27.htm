<p id="Mat27-2" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:2</a></b>And having bound Him, they led <i>Him</i> away and delivered <i>Him</i> to Pilate the governor.</p>
<p id="Mat27-3" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:3</a></b>Then Judas, who betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, regretted and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</p>
<p id="Mat27-4" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:4</a></b>saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? You see <i>to that</i> yourself!</p>
<p id="Mat27-5" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:5</a></b>And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple and departed, and he went away and hanged himself.</p>
<p id="Mat27-6" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:6</a></b>And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.</p>
<p id="Mat27-7" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:7</a></b>And after taking counsel, they bought with it the potter&rsquo;s field as a burial place for strangers.</p>
<p id="Mat27-8" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:8</a></b>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</p>
<p id="Mat27-9" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:9</a></b>At that time what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, &ldquo;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that had been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel had priced,</p>
<p id="Mat27-10" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:10</a></b>and they gave them for the potter&rsquo;s field, as the Lord directed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="Mat27-11" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:11</a></b>And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And Jesus said, <i>It</i><i> is as</i> you say.</p>

<p id="Mat27-13" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:13</a></b>Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?</p>
<p id="Mat27-14" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:14</a></b>And He did not answer him, not even to one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</p>
<p id="Mat27-15" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:15</a></b>Now at the feasts the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.</p>
<p id="Mat27-16" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:16</a></b>And they had at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</p>
<p id="Mat27-17" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:17</a></b>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?</p>
<p id="Mat27-18" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:18</a></b>For he knew that <i>it was</i> because of envy <i>that</i> they had delivered Him up.</p>
<p id="Mat27-19" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:19</a></b>And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent <i>word</i> to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of Him.</p>
<p id="Mat27-20" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:20</a></b>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to destroy Jesus.</p>
<p id="Mat27-21" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:21</a></b>And the governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you? And they said, Barabbas.</p>
<p id="Mat27-22" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:22</a></b>Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said, Let Him be crucified!</p>
<p id="Mat27-23" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:23</a></b>But he said, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let Him be crucified!</p>
<p id="Mat27-24" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:24</a></b>And Pilate, seeing that nothing was gained but rather that an uproar was taking place, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this man&rsquo;s blood. You see <i>to it</i> yourselves.</p>
<p id="Mat27-25" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:25</a></b>And all the people answered and said, His blood be upon us and upon our children!</p>
<p id="Mat27-26" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:26</a></b>Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he scourged and delivered up to be crucified.</p>
<p id="Mat27-27" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:27</a></b>Then the governor&rsquo;s soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered about Him the whole cohort.</p>
<p id="Mat27-28" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:28</a></b>And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe around Him,</p>
<p id="Mat27-29" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:29</a></b>and they wove a crown of thorns and placed <i>it</i> on His head and <i>put</i> a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled before Him and mocked Him, saying, Rejoice, King of the Jews!</p>
<p id="Mat27-30" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:30</a></b>And they spat on Him and took the reed and beat Him on the head.</p>
<p id="Mat27-31" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:31</a></b>And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His garments on Him, and led Him away to crucify <i>Him.</i></p>
<p id="Mat27-32" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:32</a></b>And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; this one they compelled to take up His cross.</p>
<p id="Mat27-33" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:33</a></b>And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,</p>
<p id="Mat27-34" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:34</a></b>they gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted <i>it,</i> He would not drink.</p>
<p id="Mat27-35" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:35</a></b>And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments <i>among themselves,</i> casting lots.</p>
<p id="Mat27-36" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:36</a></b>And they sat down and guarded Him there.</p>
<p id="Mat27-37" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:37</a></b>And they set in writing over His head the charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p id="Mat27-38" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:38</a></b>At that time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.</p>
<p id="Mat27-39" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:39</a></b>And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads</p>
<p id="Mat27-40" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:40</a></b>and saying, You who destroy the temple and build it up in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!</p>
<p id="Mat27-41" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:41</a></b>Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked <i>Him</i> and said,</p>

<p id="Mat27-43" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:43</a></b>He trusts in God; let Him rescue <i>Him</i> now if He wants Him, for He said, I am the Son of God.</p>
<p id="Mat27-44" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:44</a></b>And in the same way the robbers who were crucified with Him also reproached Him.</p>
<p id="Mat27-45" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:45</a></b>Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.</p>

<p id="Mat27-47" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:47</a></b>And some of those standing there, when they heard <i>this,</i> said, This man is calling Elijah.</p>
<p id="Mat27-48" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:48</a></b>And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he soaked it with vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave <i>it</i> to Him to drink.</p>
<p id="Mat27-49" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:49</a></b>But the rest said, Let <i>Him be.</i> Let us see if Elijah is coming to save Him.</p>
<p id="Mat27-50" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:50</a></b>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up His spirit.</p>
<p id="Mat27-51" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:51</a></b>And behold, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, and the earth was shaken and the rocks were split,</p>
<p id="Mat27-52" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 27</a><a href="40_Matthew_27.htm#Mat27">:52</a></b>and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.</p>
