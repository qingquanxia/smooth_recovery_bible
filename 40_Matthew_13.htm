<p id="Mat13-37" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 13</a><a href="40_Matthew_13.htm#Mat13">:37</a></b>And He answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;</p>
<p id="Mat13-38" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 13</a><a href="40_Matthew_13.htm#Mat13">:38</a></b>and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;</p>
<p id="Mat13-39" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 13</a><a href="40_Matthew_13.htm#Mat13">:39</a></b>and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels.</p>

<p id="Mat13-53" class="verse"><b><a href="40_Matthew_1.htm">Mt 13</a><a href="40_Matthew_13.htm#Mat13">:53</a></b>And when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.</p>
