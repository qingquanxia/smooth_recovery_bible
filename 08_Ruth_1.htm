<p id="Rut1-1" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:1</a></b>Now in the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a man from Bethlehem in Judah went down to dwell as a sojourner in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.</p>
<p id="Rut1-2" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:2</a></b>And the man&rsquo;s name was Elimelech, and his wife&rsquo;s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there.</p>
<p id="Rut1-3" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:3</a></b>And Elimelech, Naomi&rsquo;s husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.</p>
<p id="Rut1-4" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:4</a></b>And they took wives for themselves from among the Moabite women. One&rsquo;s name was Orpah, and the second&rsquo;s name was Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.</p>
<p id="Rut1-5" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:5</a></b>And both Mahlon and Chilion died, and the woman was left without her two children and her husband.</p>
<p id="Rut1-6" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:6</a></b>Then she rose up with her daughters-in-law in order to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that Jehovah had visited His people by giving them food.</p>
<p id="Rut1-7" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:7</a></b>So she went forth from the place where she had been, along with her two daughters-in-law; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</p>
<p id="Rut1-8" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:8</a></b>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go and return, each of you, to your mother&rsquo;s house. May Jehovah deal kindly with you, just as you have dealt with the dead and with me.</p>
<p id="Rut1-9" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:9</a></b>May Jehovah grant you to find rest, each of you in the house of your husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice and wept.</p>
<p id="Rut1-10" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:10</a></b>And they said to her, No, we will return with you to your people.</p>
<p id="Rut1-11" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:11</a></b>And Naomi said, Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</p>
<p id="Rut1-12" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:12</a></b>Return, my daughters, go; for I am too old to have a husband. If I said, I have hope; even if I had a husband tonight and even bore sons;</p>
<p id="Rut1-13" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:13</a></b>would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having a husband? No, my daughters; it has been far more bitter for me than <i>it should be</i> for you, for the hand of Jehovah has gone forth against me.</p>
<p id="Rut1-14" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:14</a></b>And they lifted up their voice and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</p>
<p id="Rut1-15" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:15</a></b>And she said, Your sister-in-law has now returned to her people and to her gods; return with your sister-in-law.</p>
<p id="Rut1-16" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:16</a></b>But Ruth said, Do not entreat me to leave you and turn away from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.</p>
<p id="Rut1-17" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:17</a></b>Where you die, I will die; and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more as well, if anything but death parts me from you.</p>
<p id="Rut1-18" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:18</a></b>And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she ceased speaking to her <i>about it.</i></p>
<p id="Rut1-19" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:19</a></b>So the two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them; and <i>the women</i> said, Is this Naomi?</p>
<p id="Rut1-20" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:20</a></b>And she said to them, Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara; for the All-sufficient One has dealt very bitterly with me.</p>
<p id="Rut1-21" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:21</a></b>I went out full, but Jehovah has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, when Jehovah has afflicted me and the All-sufficient One has dealt harshly with me?</p>
<p id="Rut1-22" class="verse"><b><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm">Ru 1</a><a href="08_Ruth_1.htm#Rut1">:22</a></b>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.</p>
