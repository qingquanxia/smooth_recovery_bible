<p id="Eze33-6" class="verse"><b><a href="26_Ezekiel_1.htm">Ezk 33</a><a href="26_Ezekiel_33.htm#Eze33">:6</a></b>But if the watchman sees the sword come and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned and the sword comes and takes someone away from them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
