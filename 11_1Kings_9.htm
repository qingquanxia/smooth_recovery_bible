<p id="FKi9-4" class="verse"><b><a href="11_1Kings_1.htm">1K 9</a><a href="11_1Kings_9.htm#FKi9">:4</a></b>And as for you, if you walk before Me, as David your father walked, with a perfect and upright heart by doing according to all that I have commanded you <i>and</i> keep My statutes and My ordinances,</p>
<p id="FKi9-5" class="verse"><b><a href="11_1Kings_1.htm">1K 9</a><a href="11_1Kings_9.htm#FKi9">:5</a></b>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised to David your father, saying, You will not lack a man on the throne of Israel.</p>

<p id="FKi9-9" class="verse"><b><a href="11_1Kings_1.htm">1K 9</a><a href="11_1Kings_9.htm#FKi9">:9</a></b>And they will say, Because they forsook Jehovah their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold of other gods and worshipped them and served them; therefore Jehovah brought all this evil upon them.</p>

<p id="FKi9-11" class="verse"><b><a href="11_1Kings_1.htm">1K 9</a><a href="11_1Kings_9.htm#FKi9">:11</a></b>since Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar wood and with cypress wood and with gold, according to all that he desired, King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</p>

<p id="FKi9-20" class="verse"><b><a href="11_1Kings_1.htm">1K 9</a><a href="11_1Kings_9.htm#FKi9">:20</a></b>All of the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel,</p>

<p id="FKi9-22" class="verse"><b><a href="11_1Kings_1.htm">1K 9</a><a href="11_1Kings_9.htm#FKi9">:22</a></b>But Solomon did not make slaves of the children of Israel; for they were the men of war and his servants and his officers and his captains and the officers over his chariots and his horsemen.</p>
<p id="FKi9-23" class="verse"><b><a href="11_1Kings_1.htm">1K 9</a><a href="11_1Kings_9.htm#FKi9">:23</a></b>These were the chief of the officers over Solomon&rsquo;s work, five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people doing the work.</p>
<p id="FKi9-24" class="verse"><b><a href="11_1Kings_1.htm">1K 9</a><a href="11_1Kings_9.htm#FKi9">:24</a></b>As soon as Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter came up from the city of David into her house which Solomon had built for her, he built the Millo.</p>
<p id="FKi9-25" class="verse"><b><a href="11_1Kings_1.htm">1K 9</a><a href="11_1Kings_9.htm#FKi9">:25</a></b>And three times a year Solomon offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built to Jehovah, and he burned incense with them <i>on the altar</i> which was before Jehovah.
