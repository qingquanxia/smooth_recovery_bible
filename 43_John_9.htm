<p id="Joh9-3" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:3</a></b>Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but <i>he was born so,</i> that the works of God might be manifested in him.</p>
<p id="Joh9-4" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:4</a></b>We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.</p>
<p id="Joh9-5" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:5</a></b>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
<p id="Joh9-6" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:6</a></b>When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay,</p>
<p id="Joh9-7" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:7</a></b>and He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is interpreted, Sent). He went therefore and washed and came <i>away</i> seeing.</p>
<p id="Joh9-8" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:8</a></b>The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?</p>
<p id="Joh9-9" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:9</a></b>Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am <i>the one.</i></p>
<p id="Joh9-10" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:10</a></b>They said then to him, How then were your eyes opened?</p>
<p id="Joh9-11" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:11</a></b>He answered, The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the <i>pool</i> of Siloam and wash. I went therefore and washed, and I received my sight.</p>
<p id="Joh9-12" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:12</a></b>And they said to him, Where is He? He said, I do not know.</p>

<p id="Joh9-14" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:14</a></b>Now it was the Sabbath, on which day Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</p>
<p id="Joh9-15" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:15</a></b>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</p>
<p id="Joh9-16" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:16</a></b>Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man <i>who is</i> a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.</p>
<p id="Joh9-17" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:17</a></b>Then they said to the blind man again, What do you say about Him, in that He opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</p>
<p id="Joh9-18" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:18</a></b>The Jews then did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight</p>
<p id="Joh9-19" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:19</a></b>and asked them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was born blind? How then does he now see?</p>
<p id="Joh9-20" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:20</a></b>Then his parents answered <i>them</i> and said, We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.</p>
<p id="Joh9-21" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:21</a></b>But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age; he will speak for himself.</p>
<p id="Joh9-22" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:22</a></b>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him <i>to be the</i> Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p id="Joh9-23" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:23</a></b>Because of this his parents said, He is of age; question him.</p>
<p id="Joh9-24" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:24</a></b>Therefore a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.</p>
<p id="Joh9-25" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:25</a></b>Then he answered, Whether <i>or not</i> He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.</p>
<p id="Joh9-26" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:26</a></b>They said then to him, What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?</p>
<p id="Joh9-27" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:27</a></b>He answered them, I told you already and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear <i>it</i> again? Do you also want to become His disciples?</p>
<p id="Joh9-28" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:28</a></b>And they reviled him and said, You are His disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.</p>
<p id="Joh9-29" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:29</a></b>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from.</p>
<p id="Joh9-30" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:30</a></b>The man answered and said to them, Why here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and <i>yet</i> He opened my eyes!</p>
<p id="Joh9-31" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:31</a></b>We know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.</p>
<p id="Joh9-32" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:32</a></b>Since time began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.</p>
<p id="Joh9-33" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:33</a></b>If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.</p>
<p id="Joh9-34" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:34</a></b>They answered and said to him, You were wholly born in sins, and you are teaching us? And they cast him out.</p>

<p id="Joh9-38" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:38</a></b>And he said, Lord, I believe; and he worshipped Him.</p>
<p id="Joh9-39" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:39</a></b>And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.</p>
<p id="Joh9-40" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 9</a><a href="43_John_9.htm#Joh9">:40</a></b><i>Some</i> of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, We are not blind also, are we?</p>
