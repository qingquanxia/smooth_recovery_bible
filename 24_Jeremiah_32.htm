<p id="Jer32-2" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:2</a></b>Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p id="Jer32-3" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:3</a></b>For Zedekiah the king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it;</p>
<p id="Jer32-4" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:4</a></b>and Zedekiah the king of Judah will not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but he will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and will speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes will see his eyes;</p>
<p id="Jer32-5" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:5</a></b>and he will bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him, declares Jehovah; though you fight with the Chaldeans, you will not prosper?</p>
<p id="Jer32-6" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:6</a></b>And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</p>

<p id="Jer32-9" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:9</a></b>And I bought the field which was in Anathoth from Hanamel, my uncle&rsquo;s son, and I weighed out for him the money, seventeen shekels of silver.</p>
<p id="Jer32-10" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:10</a></b>And I signed and sealed the deed and called witnesses and weighed out the money on scales.</p>
<p id="Jer32-11" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:11</a></b>Then I took the deed of purchase, the sealed part, <i>containing</i> the terms and conditions, and the open part;</p>
<p id="Jer32-12" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:12</a></b>and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel, my uncle&rsquo;s <i>son,</i> and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, before all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard.</p>

<p id="Jer32-19" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:19</a></b>great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, giving to each according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds;</p>
<p id="Jer32-20" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:20</a></b>who have set signs and wonders unto this day in the land of Egypt and in Israel and among mankind and have made a name for Yourself, as in this day.</p>
<p id="Jer32-21" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:21</a></b>And You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror.</p>
<p id="Jer32-22" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:22</a></b>And You gave them this land, which You had sworn to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p id="Jer32-23" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:23</a></b>And they entered and took possession of it, but they did not listen to Your voice or walk in Your law. They have not done anything of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this evil to happen to them.</p>
<p id="Jer32-24" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:24</a></b>See the siege mounds, <i>which</i> come up to the city to capture it.

<p id="Jer32-35" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:35</a></b>And they built the high places of Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom in order to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through <i>fire</i> to Molech, something I did not command them <i>to do,</i> nor did it come up in My heart that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</p>
<p id="Jer32-36" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 32</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_32.htm#Jer32">:36</a></b>And now therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Israel concerning this city of which you say, It has been given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword and by famine and by pestilence.</p>
