<p id="FSa3-12" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 3</a><a href="09_1Samuel_3.htm#FSa3">:12</a></b>On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.</p>
<p id="FSa3-13" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 3</a><a href="09_1Samuel_3.htm#FSa3">:13</a></b>For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever because of the iniquity which he knew; for his sons brought the curse upon themselves, and he did not restrain them.</p>
<p id="FSa3-14" class="verse"><b><a href="09_1Samuel_1.htm">1S 3</a><a href="09_1Samuel_3.htm#FSa3">:14</a></b>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of the house of Eli shall not be expiated by sacrifice or by offering forever.</p>
