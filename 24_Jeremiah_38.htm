<p id="Jer38-21" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 38</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_38.htm#Jer38">:21</a></b>But if you refuse to surrender, this is the word that Jehovah has shown me:</p>
<p id="Jer38-22" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 38</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_38.htm#Jer38">:22</a></b>(T/t)hen all the women who have been left in the house of the king of Judah will be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon, and the women will say <i>concerning the king,</i><br /><span class="acolon" />Your familiar friends /<span class="bcolon" /> Have deceived you and prevailed over you; /<span class="acolon" /> While your feet sank in the mire, /<span class="bcolon" /> They turned away from <i>you.</i></p>
<p id="Jer38-23" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 38</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_38.htm#Jer38">:23</a></b>And they will lead out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and you will cause this city to be burned with fire.</p>

<p id="Jer38-25" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 38</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_38.htm#Jer38">:25</a></b>But if the princes hear that I have spoken with you and they come to you and say to you, Tell us now what you said to the king; do not hide <i>it</i> from us, and we will not put you to death; now what did the king say to you?</p>
<p id="Jer38-26" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 38</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_38.htm#Jer38">:26</a></b>Then you shall say to them, I made my supplication before the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.</p>
<p id="Jer38-27" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 38</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_38.htm#Jer38">:27</a></b>Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him.
