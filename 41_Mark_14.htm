<p id="Mar14-2" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:2</a></b>for they said, Not at the feast, lest there be a tumult by the people.</p>

<p id="Mar14-5" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:5</a></b>For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor. And they were infuriated with her.</p>

<p id="Mar14-7" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:7</a></b>For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you do not always have Me.</p>
<p id="Mar14-8" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:8</a></b>She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.</p>

<p id="Mar14-15" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:15</a></b>And he will show you a large upper room, furnished <i>and</i> ready. And there prepare for us.</p>
<p id="Mar14-16" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:16</a></b>And the disciples went out and came into the city and found <i>it</i> even as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.</p>
<p id="Mar14-17" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:17</a></b>And when evening fell, He came with the twelve.</p>
<p id="Mar14-18" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:18</a></b>And as they were reclining <i>at table</i> and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me, one who is eating with Me.</p>
<p id="Mar14-19" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:19</a></b>They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, Surely not I?</p>

<p id="Mar14-21" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:21</a></b>For the Son of Man is going away, even as it is written concerning Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.</p>
<p id="Mar14-22" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:22</a></b>And as they were eating, He took bread and blessed <i>it,</i> and He broke <i>it</i> and gave <i>it</i> to them, and said, Take; this is My body.</p>
<p id="Mar14-23" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:23</a></b>And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave <i>it</i> to them; and they all drank of it.</p>

<p id="Mar14-26" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:26</a></b>And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p id="Mar14-27" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:27</a></b>And Jesus said to them, You will all be stumbled, because it is written, &ldquo;I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="Mar14-28" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:28</a></b>But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>

<p id="Mar14-36" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:36</a></b>And He said, Abba Father, all things are possible to You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You <i>will.</i></p>
<p id="Mar14-37" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 14</a><a href="41_Mark_14.htm#Mar14">:37</a></b>And He came and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not able to watch for one hour?</p>
