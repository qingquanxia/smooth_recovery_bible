<p id="Jud14-13" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 14</a><a href="07_Judges_14.htm#Jud14">:13</a></b>but if you cannot explain <i>it</i> to me, you shall give me thirty fine linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. And they said to him, Put forth your riddle, let us hear it.</p>
<p id="Jud14-14" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 14</a><a href="07_Judges_14.htm#Jud14">:14</a></b>And he said to them,<span class="acolon" /> Out of the eater came forth food, /<span class="bcolon" /> And out of the strong came forth sweetness.<br /> And they could not explain the riddle after three days.</p>
