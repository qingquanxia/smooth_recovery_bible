<p id="Jer44-3" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:3</a></b>because of their wickedness which they did to provoke Me to anger, in that they went to burn incense to serve other gods, which they did not know, neither they, you, nor your fathers.</p>
<p id="Jer44-4" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:4</a></b>Yet I sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending <i>them,</i> saying, Do not do this abominable thing which I hate.</p>
<p id="Jer44-5" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:5</a></b>But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn incense to other gods.</p>
<p id="Jer44-6" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:6</a></b>And My wrath and My anger poured forth and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became a waste and a desolation, as <i>they are</i> this day.</p>

<p id="Jer44-8" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:8</a></b>provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have come to sojourn, so that you might be cut off and that you might become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</p>
<p id="Jer44-9" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:9</a></b>Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and the wickedness of the kings of Judah and the wickedness of their wives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives, which they did in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</p>
<p id="Jer44-10" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:10</a></b>They have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared or walked in My law or in My statutes, which I set before you and before your fathers.</p>

<p id="Jer44-12" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:12</a></b>And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go to the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they will all be consumed; in the land of Egypt they will fall; by sword <i>and</i> by famine they will be consumed. From the small even unto the great, by sword and by famine they will die; and they will become an execration, an astonishment, and a curse and a reproach.</p>
<p id="Jer44-13" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:13</a></b>And I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem: with sword, with famine, and with pestilence.</p>
<p id="Jer44-14" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:14</a></b>And there will not be one who has escaped nor a survivor of the remnant of Judah, who went to sojourn there in the land of Egypt, even to return to the land of Judah, where they desire to return to dwell; for they will not return, except for some who will escape.</p>
<p id="Jer44-15" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:15</a></b>Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods and all the women who stood by, a great assemblage, even all the people who dwelt in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah, saying,</p>
<p id="Jer44-16" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:16</a></b>As for the word which you have spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, we will not listen to you.</p>
<p id="Jer44-17" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:17</a></b>But we will surely do everything which has gone out of our mouth, burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, just as we ourselves and our fathers, our kings, and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for we had plenty of food and were well off and did not see evil.</p>
<p id="Jer44-18" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:18</a></b>But since we ceased burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by sword and by famine.</p>
<p id="Jer44-19" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:19</a></b>And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out libations to her, did we make cakes to her, making images of her and pouring out libations to her, without our husbands?</p>
<p id="Jer44-20" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:20</a></b>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people concerning the men and concerning the women, even concerning all the people who had given him that answer, saying,</p>
<p id="Jer44-21" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:21</a></b>As for the incense which you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and did it not come up in His heart?</p>
<p id="Jer44-22" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:22</a></b>And Jehovah was no longer able to bear <i>it</i> because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you committed; therefore your land has become a desolation and an astonishment and a curse, without inhabitant, as <i>it is</i> this day.</p>
<p id="Jer44-23" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:23</a></b>Because you burned incense and because you sinned against Jehovah and did not listen to the voice of Jehovah or walk in His law or in His statutes or in His testimonies, therefore this evil has happened to you, as <i>it is</i> this day.</p>
<p id="Jer44-24" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:24</a></b>Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt:</p>
<p id="Jer44-25" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:25</a></b>Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and have fulfilled <i>it</i> with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows by which we have vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out libations to her. Establish then your vows, and by all means perform your vows.</p>
<p id="Jer44-26" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:26</a></b>Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt, I have sworn by My great name, says Jehovah: My name shall no longer be called upon by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Jehovah lives.</p>
<p id="Jer44-27" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:27</a></b>I will be watchful over them for evil and not for good, and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by sword and by famine until there is an end of them.</p>
<p id="Jer44-28" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:28</a></b>And those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number, and all the remnant of Judah who came to the land of Egypt to sojourn there will know whose word will be established, Mine or theirs.</p>
<p id="Jer44-29" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:29</a></b>And this will be a sign to you, declares Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, so that you will know that My words will surely be established against you for evil:</p>
<p id="Jer44-30" class="verse"><b><a href="24_Jeremiah_1.htm">Je 44</a><a href="24_Jeremiah_44.htm#Jer44">:30</a></b>Thus says Jehovah, I will give Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, who was his enemy and sought his life.</p>
