<p id="Joh6-17" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 6</a><a href="43_John_6.htm#Joh6">:17</a></b>and they got into a boat and began crossing the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</p>
<p id="Joh6-18" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 6</a><a href="43_John_6.htm#Joh6">:18</a></b>And because a strong wind was blowing, the sea was churning.</p>
<p id="Joh6-19" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 6</a><a href="43_John_6.htm#Joh6">:19</a></b>Then, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they became frightened.</p>

<p id="Joh6-22" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 6</a><a href="43_John_6.htm#Joh6">:22</a></b>The next day the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but <i>that</i> His disciples had gone away alone.</p>
<p id="Joh6-23" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 6</a><a href="43_John_6.htm#Joh6">:23</a></b>But other small boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</p>
<p id="Joh6-24" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 6</a><a href="43_John_6.htm#Joh6">:24</a></b>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</p>

<p id="Joh6-26" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 6</a><a href="43_John_6.htm#Joh6">:26</a></b>Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled.</p>
<p id="Joh6-27" class="verse"><b><a href="43_John_1.htm">Jn 6</a><a href="43_John_6.htm#Joh6">:27</a></b>Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, <i>even</i> God, sealed.</p>
