<p id="Dan9-1" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:1</a></b>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, a Median descendant who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,</p>
<p id="Dan9-2" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:2</a></b>in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by means of the Scriptures the number of the years, which came as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, <i>that is,</i> seventy years.</p>
<p id="Dan9-3" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:3</a></b>So I set my face toward the Lord God to seek <i>Him</i> in prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<p id="Dan9-4" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:4</a></b>And I prayed to Jehovah my God and confessed; and I said, Ah, Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments,</p>
<p id="Dan9-5" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:5</a></b>we have sinned and have committed iniquity, and we have acted wickedly and rebelled, <i>to the point of</i> even turning away from Your commandments and from Your judgments.</p>
<p id="Dan9-6" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:6</a></b>And we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our chief men, and our fathers, as well as to all the people of the land.</p>
<p id="Dan9-7" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:7</a></b>To You, Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us, shamefacedness, as it is this day, <i>that is,</i> to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far off in all the lands to which You have driven them because of their trespass by which they have trespassed against You.</p>
<p id="Dan9-8" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:8</a></b>O Jehovah, to us belongs shamefacedness, to our kings, our chief men, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You.</p>
<p id="Dan9-9" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:9</a></b>To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him;</p>
<p id="Dan9-10" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:10</a></b>and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in His instruction, which He set before us through the hand of His servants the prophets.</p>
<p id="Dan9-11" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:11</a></b>Indeed, all Israel has transgressed Your law, <i>to the point of</i> even turning away so as not to obey Your voice; thus the curse has been poured out upon us, the very oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against Him.</p>
<p id="Dan9-12" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:12</a></b>And He has confirmed His words which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us great ill; for under all heaven there has not been done anything like that which has been done in Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="Dan9-13" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:13</a></b>As it is written in the law of Moses, all this ill has come upon us, yet we have not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God by turning from our iniquities and attending to Your truth.</p>
<p id="Dan9-14" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:14</a></b>Therefore Jehovah has been vigilant with the ill and has brought it upon us, for Jehovah our God is righteous in all the deeds that He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice.</p>
<p id="Dan9-15" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:15</a></b>And now, O Lord our God, who have brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made for Yourself a name, as it is this day, we have sinned, we have been wicked.</p>
<p id="Dan9-16" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:16</a></b>O Lord, in accordance with all the manifestations of Your righteousness, may Your anger and Your wrath be turned away, I pray, from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people are a reproach to all those around us.</p>
<p id="Dan9-17" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:17</a></b>And now hear, O our God, the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, and cause Your face to shine upon Your sanctuary that has been desolated, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p id="Dan9-18" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:18</a></b>O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city that is called by Your name; for we are not presenting our supplications before You based upon any righteous doings that we have done, but based upon Your great compassion.</p>
<p id="Dan9-19" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:19</a></b>O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! Do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God; for Your city and Your people are called by Your <i>own</i> name.</p>
<p id="Dan9-20" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:20</a></b>And while I was still speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God,</p>
<p id="Dan9-21" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:21</a></b>even while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, reached me in <i>my</i> utter exhaustion about the time of the evening oblation.</p>
<p id="Dan9-22" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:22</a></b>And he informed <i>me</i> and talked with me and said, Daniel, I have now come forth to give you insight with understanding.</p>
<p id="Dan9-23" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:23</a></b>At the beginning of your supplications the command went forth, and I have come to tell <i>you,</i> for you are preciousness itself. Therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.</p>
<p id="Dan9-24" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:24</a></b>Seventy weeks are apportioned for your people and for your holy city, to close the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make propitiation for iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p id="Dan9-25" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:25</a></b>Know therefore and comprehend: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until <i>the time of</i> Messiah the Prince will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with street and trench, even in distressful times.</p>
<p id="Dan9-26" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:26</a></b>And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing; and the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end <i>there will be</i> war; desolations are determined.</p>
<p id="Dan9-27" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 9</a><a href="27_Daniel_9.htm#Dan9">:27</a></b>And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week; and in the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator, even until the complete destruction that has been determined is poured out upon the desolator.</p>
