And the camp of Midian was to their north, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</p>
<p id="Jud7-2" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:2</a></b>And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people with you are too many for Me to deliver Midian into their hand; Israel might vaunt himself against Me, saying, My own hand has saved me.</p>
<p id="Jud7-3" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:3</a></b>Now then proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, Whoever is afraid and trembling should return and depart from here. And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.</p>
<p id="Jud7-4" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:4</a></b>Then Jehovah said to Gideon, The people are still too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. And he of whom I say to you, This one shall go with you, he shall go with you. And every one of whom I say to you, This one shall not go with you, he shall not go.</p>
<p id="Jud7-5" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:5</a></b>So he brought the people down to the water. And Jehovah said to Gideon, Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.</p>
<p id="Jud7-6" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:6</a></b>And the number of those who lapped <i>the water</i> into their mouth with their hand was three hundred men, but the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</p>
<p id="Jud7-7" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:7</a></b>And Jehovah said to Gideon, Through the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and I will deliver Midian into your hand. But let all the <i>other</i> people go, each to his own place.</p>
<p id="Jud7-8" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:8</a></b>Then the people took provisions in their hand and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel away, each to his own tent, but retained the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.</p>
<p id="Jud7-9" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:9</a></b>And that night Jehovah said to him, Arise; go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.</p>
<p id="Jud7-10" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:10</a></b>But if you are afraid to go down, go down with Purah your young man into the camp;</p>
<p id="Jud7-11" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:11</a></b>and you will hear what they are saying. Then afterward your hands will be strengthened so that you can go down against the camp. So he went down with Purah his young man to the edge of the battle array that was in the camp.</p>
<p id="Jud7-12" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:12</a></b>Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay in the valley like a locust swarm in multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand on the seashore is in multitude.</p>
<p id="Jud7-13" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:13</a></b>And when Gideon came, at that moment a man was recounting a dream to his companion; and he said, I have just had a dream. There was this round loaf of barley bread tumbling through the camp of Midian. And it came to the tent and struck it so that it fell, and it turned it upside down. And the tent collapsed.</p>
<p id="Jud7-14" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:14</a></b>And his companion answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his hand.</p>
<p id="Jud7-15" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:15</a></b>And when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.</p>
<p id="Jud7-16" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:16</a></b>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies; and he put trumpets into the hands of them all, as well as empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers.</p>
<p id="Jud7-17" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:17</a></b>And he said to them, Look at me, and do as <i>I do.</i> Right when I come to the edge of the camp, you shall do just as I do.</p>
<p id="Jud7-18" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:18</a></b>When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet, you also blow the trumpets around all the camp and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon!</p>
<p id="Jud7-19" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:19</a></b>So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch. They had just then posted the watch. And they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.</p>
<p id="Jud7-20" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:20</a></b>And the three companies blew the trumpets and shattered the pitchers; and they held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets were in their right hands to blow. And they cried out, A sword for Jehovah and for Gideon!</p>
<p id="Jud7-21" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:21</a></b>And each man stood in his place around the camp. Then the whole camp ran off, and they shouted and fled.</p>
<p id="Jud7-22" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:22</a></b>And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set each man&rsquo;s sword against his companion and against the whole camp. And the camp fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the edge of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</p>
<p id="Jud7-23" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:23</a></b>And the men of Israel were called up from Naphtali and from Asher and from all of Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.</p>
<p id="Jud7-24" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:24</a></b>Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and seize the waters against them as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan. And every man of Ephraim was called up, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.</p>
<p id="Jud7-25" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 7</a><a href="07_Judges_7.htm#Jud7">:25</a></b>And they captured two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb; and they pursued Midian. And they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.</p>
