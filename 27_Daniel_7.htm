<p id="Dan7-1" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:1</a></b>In the first year of Belshazzar the king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed. Then he wrote down the dream; he related the sum of the matters.</p>
<p id="Dan7-2" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:2</a></b>Daniel responded and said, I was watching in my vision by night, and there were the four winds of heaven, stirring up the Great Sea.</p>
<p id="Dan7-3" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:3</a></b>And four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.</p>
<p id="Dan7-4" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:4</a></b>The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man; and a man&rsquo;s heart was given to it.</p>
<p id="Dan7-5" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:5</a></b>And there was another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.</p>
<p id="Dan7-6" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:6</a></b>After this I watched and there was another <i>beast,</i> like a leopard; and it had four wings of a bird on its back; and the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it.</p>
<p id="Dan7-7" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:7</a></b>After this I watched in the night visions, and there was a fourth beast, dreadful and frightful and exceedingly strong; and it had large iron teeth; it devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</p>
<p id="Dan7-8" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:8</a></b>I was considering the horns; then there was another horn, a small one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted from before it. And there were eyes like the eyes of a man in this horn and a mouth speaking great things.</p>
<p id="Dan7-9" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:9</a></b><span class="acolon" />I watched /<span class="acolon" /> Until thrones were set, /<span class="bcolon" /> And the Ancient of Days sat down. /<span class="acolon" /> His clothing was like white snow, /<span class="bcolon" /> And the hair of His head was like pure wool; /<span class="acolon" /> His throne was flames of fire; /<span class="bcolon" /> Its wheels, burning fire.</p>
<p id="Dan7-10" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:10</a></b><span class="acolon" />A stream of fire issued forth /<span class="bcolon" /> And came out from before Him. /<span class="acolon" /> Thousands of thousands ministered to Him, /<span class="bcolon" /> And ten thousands of ten thousands stood before Him. /<span class="acolon" /> The court of judgment sat, /<span class="bcolon" /> And the books were opened.</p>
<p id="Dan7-11" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:11</a></b>I watched then because of the sound of the great things that the horn was speaking; I watched until the beast was slain and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire.</p>
<p id="Dan7-12" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:12</a></b>And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for a season and a time.</p>
<p id="Dan7-13" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:13</a></b><span class="acolon" />I watched in the night visions, /<span class="acolon" /> And there with the clouds of heaven /<span class="bcolon" /> One like a Son of Man was coming; /<span class="acolon" /> And He came to the Ancient of Days, /<span class="bcolon" /> And they brought Him near before Him.</p>
<p id="Dan7-14" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:14</a></b><span class="acolon" />And to Him was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, /<span class="acolon" /> That all the peoples, nations, and languages might serve Him. /<span class="acolon" /> His dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not pass away; /<span class="acolon" /> And His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.</p>
<p id="Dan7-15" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:15</a></b>As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was distressed, and the visions of my head alarmed me.</p>
<p id="Dan7-16" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:16</a></b>I came near to one of those standing by and asked of him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made the interpretation of the things known to me:</p>
<p id="Dan7-17" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:17</a></b>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings <i>who</i> will arise from the earth.</p>
<p id="Dan7-18" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:18</a></b>But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, indeed, forever and ever.</p>
<p id="Dan7-19" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:19</a></b>Then I wished to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, <i>which</i> devoured, crushed, and trampled under the remainder with its feet,</p>
<p id="Dan7-20" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:20</a></b>and of the ten horns that were on its head, and the other <i>horn</i> that came up, and before which three <i>horns</i> fell, even that horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking great things and whose appearance was greater than that of its companions.</p>
<p id="Dan7-21" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:21</a></b>I watched and that horn waged war with the saints and prevailed against them,</p>
<p id="Dan7-22" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:22</a></b>until the Ancient of Days came; and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.</p>
<p id="Dan7-23" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:23</a></b>Thus he said, The fourth beast will be the fourth kingdom upon the earth, which will be different from all the <i>other</i> kingdoms; and it will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it.</p>
<p id="Dan7-24" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:24</a></b>And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise, and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones; and he will subdue three kings.</p>
<p id="Dan7-25" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:25</a></b>And he will speak things against the Most High and wear out the saints of the Most High; and his intention will be to change the times and the law; and they will be given into his hand for a time and times and half a time.</p>
<p id="Dan7-26" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:26</a></b>But the court of judgment will sit, and they will take away his dominion, so as to annihilate and destroy <i>it</i> unto the end.</p>
<p id="Dan7-27" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:27</a></b>And the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.</p>
<p id="Dan7-28" class="verse"><b><a href="27_Daniel_1.htm">Dn 7</a><a href="27_Daniel_7.htm#Dan7">:28</a></b>Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts alarmed me greatly, and my countenance was changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.</p>
