<p id="Jud9-24" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:24</a></b>so that the violence <i>done to</i> the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be avenged and so that their blood might be put upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the lords of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brothers.</p>
<p id="Jud9-25" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:25</a></b>And the lords of Shechem set men in ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed everyone who passed by them on the way; and Abimelech was told.</p>

<p id="Jud9-37" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:37</a></b>And Gaal spoke again and said, Look, people are coming down from the height of the land, and one company is coming by the way of the terebinth of Meonenim.</p>
<p id="Jud9-38" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:38</a></b>Then Zebul said to him, Where is your boast now, that you said, Who is Abimelech that we should serve him? Is not this the people that you despised? Go out now, and fight them.</p>

<p id="Jud9-46" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:46</a></b>And when all the lords of the tower of Shechem heard of <i>it,</i> they went to the stronghold of the house of El-berith.</p>
<p id="Jud9-47" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:47</a></b>And Abimelech was told that all the lords of the tower of Shechem had gathered together.</p>
<p id="Jud9-48" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:48</a></b>And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him.

And he lifted it up and put <i>it</i> on his shoulder, and he said to the people who were with him, What you see me doing, hurry <i>and</i> do as I <i>have done.</i></p>
<p id="Jud9-49" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:49</a></b>So all the people also cut down each a limb. And they followed after Abimelech and set <i>the limbs</i> against the stronghold. And they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the men of the tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.</p>
<p id="Jud9-50" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:50</a></b>Then Abimelech went to Thebez; and he encamped against Thebez and took it.</p>
<p id="Jud9-51" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:51</a></b>But there was a strong tower in the middle of the city; and all the men and women and all the lords of the city fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up to the roof of the tower.</p>
<p id="Jud9-52" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:52</a></b>And Abimelech came up to the tower and fought against it. And he came near the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire.</p>
<p id="Jud9-53" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:53</a></b>And a certain woman threw an upper millstone upon Abimelech&rsquo;s head, and it cracked his skull.</p>
<p id="Jud9-54" class="verse"><b><a href="07_Judges_1.htm">Jg 9</a><a href="07_Judges_9.htm#Jud9">:54</a></b>Then he called immediately to the young man who bore his armor and said to him, Draw your sword and kill me; otherwise they will say concerning me, A woman slew him.
