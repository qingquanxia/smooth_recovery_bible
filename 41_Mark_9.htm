<p id="Mar9-2" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:2</a></b>And after six days Jesus took with <i>Him</i> Peter and James and John, and brought them up alone into a high mountain privately. And He was transfigured before them,</p>
<p id="Mar9-3" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:3</a></b>and His garments became sparkling, exceedingly white, such as no fuller on earth could whiten <i>them.</i></p>
<p id="Mar9-4" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:4</a></b>And Elijah with Moses appeared to them, and they were conversing with Jesus.</p>

<p id="Mar9-6" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:6</a></b>For he did not know what to answer, for they had become extremely frightened.</p>

<p id="Mar9-19" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:19</a></b>And He answered them and said, O unbelieving generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me.</p>
<p id="Mar9-20" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:20</a></b>And they brought him to Him. And when it saw Him, the spirit immediately convulsed him greatly, and falling on the earth, he rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</p>
<p id="Mar9-21" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:21</a></b>And He questioned his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood.</p>
<p id="Mar9-22" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:22</a></b>And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him. But if You can <i>do</i> anything, have compassion on us and help us.</p>
<p id="Mar9-23" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:23</a></b>And Jesus said to him, You say, If You can. All things are possible to him who believes.</p>
<p id="Mar9-24" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:24</a></b>Immediately, crying out, the father of the child said, I believe; help my unbelief!</p>
<p id="Mar9-25" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:25</a></b>And Jesus, seeing that a crowd was running together toward <i>them,</i> rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Dumb and deaf spirit, I order you, come out of him and enter into him no more.</p>
<p id="Mar9-26" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:26</a></b>And after crying out and convulsing <i>him</i> terribly, it came out. And he became as though <i>he were</i> dead so that many said that he died.</p>
<p id="Mar9-27" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:27</a></b>But Jesus took hold of his hand and raised him, and he stood up.</p>

<p id="Mar9-34" class="verse"><b><a href="41_Mark_1.htm">Mk 9</a><a href="41_Mark_9.htm#Mar9">:34</a></b>And they were silent, for they had argued with one another on the way about who <i>was</i> greater.</p>
